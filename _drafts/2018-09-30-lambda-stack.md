Some time ago I've discovered an interesting Ubuntu package called Lambda Stack.
The package is developed by Lambda Labs company for their Deep Learning machines
but is available as a free software for anyone who is interested in it. In this
post I am describing the process of Lambda Stack installation onto Ubuntu 18.04
machine with a single GTX 1080Ti GPU.

As it was noted in [my first post](), the process of OS installation is quite
straightforward.
